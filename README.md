# ieee-test

This is a test of an environment.

samans is the owner of this repository

samans-ncc75567 has a clone of this on their local pc

The idea is to have something like this "ieee-test" repository for use by IEEE 802.1 Yang editors.
The IEEE 802.1 Yang editors would not need to fork or clone the IETF's YangModels/Yang.
IEEE 802.1 YANGsters could appoint a few people to merge the changes from the IEEE's repository to the IETF's repository.

This is a change I just made.
